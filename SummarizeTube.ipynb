            "Summary: - The lyrics describe a problematic but thrilling relationship where the couple are attracted to each other despite knowing the relationship might crash and burn.\n",
            "- The song makes references to iconic 1950s movie star James Dean and the classic style of that time period. \n",
            "- The song repeats the line 'We never go out of style' as a testament to the strength of the relationship despite its flaws. \n",
            "- The singer asks to be taken home at the end of the song, implying a desire to escape the relationship despite still being drawn to the other person. \n",
            "- The song is performed with a catchy, repeating melody and a poppy production style. In the context of the album, the song can be interpreted as the climax of the story it tells, a turning point where the main character decides to confront their destructive tendencies and move forward in a more positive direction.\n"
